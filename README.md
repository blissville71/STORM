# STORM 1.0
STOchastic Rainstorm Model

To understand how to run the code for particular basin, see detailed information in STORM.m code (Matlab) or STORM.py (Python).

The model was first introduced in: Singer, M.B. and K. Michaelides, 2017. Deciphering the expression of climate change within the Lower Colorado River basin by stochastic simulation of convective rainfall. Environmental Research Letters 12, 10.1088/1748-9326/aa8e50.

The model development is described in detail in: Singer, M.B., K. Michaelides, D.E.J. Hobley, 2018. STORM 1.0: a simple, flexible, and parsimonious stochastic rainfall generator for simulating climate and climate change, Geoscientific Model Development, 11, 3713-3726, 2018
