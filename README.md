# STORM
STOchastic Rainstorm Model

To understand how to run the code for particular basin, see detailed information in STORM.m code (Matlab) or STORM.py (Python).

The model was first introduced in: Singer, M.B. and K. Michaelides, 2017. Deciphering the expression of climate change within the Lower Colorado River basin by stochastic simulation of convective rainfall. Environmental Research Letters 12, 10.1088/1748-9326/aa8e50.

The model development is described in detail in: Singer, M.B., K. Michaelides, D.E.J. Hobley, 2018. STORM: A simple, flexible, and parsimonious stochastic rainfall generator for simulating climate and climate change, Geoscientific Model Development, Discussion Paper,
